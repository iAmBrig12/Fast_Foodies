# Fast Foodies

## Project Description
People need to eat, and coincidentally, are short on time. Here comes our idea for our fast food restaurant. We are basing our database on the functions and business model of said fast-food restaurant.

## Assumptions
- Cooks will not eat the food
- Front staff cannot be cooks or managers
- Managers cannot be cooks
- Customers can either order through the drive-thru or sit down, not both
- One cook can cook multiple orders
- One customer can make multiple orders
- One front staff can serve multiple customers
- Customers cannot substitute or add ingredients
- Managers will manage a group of employees in the restaurant 
- A Cook can cook any order
- All burgers have two buns and one patty
- All customers who enter the restaurant make an order
- Receipt will be either printed or emailed, no "none" option
- Customer will only talk to one front staff per order
